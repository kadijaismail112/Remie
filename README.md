Welcome to **Remie!**  

To use our site you must have **Python**, **Venv**, and **Flask** installed/set. You must also download all the modules used in this project as well. There is a [requirements.txt](Remie/requirements.txt) file that lists all the required modules, including their versions. 

Please ensure that the `Flask-SQLAlchemy` and `SQLAlchemy` modules installed are the same verison as in the requirements.txt file. Newer versions of these modules may not be supported.

We are currently still working on configuring this repository so that it will work on your machine.
The current repository requires certain key permissions in the Google CSE API that need to be imported,
but cannot be imported without the proper permissions. We are working on a solution to this problem.
Please keep posted and we will let you know once we are able to do so!


Once everything is set, in the terminal cd into Remie then run the command:

**python3 app.py**
